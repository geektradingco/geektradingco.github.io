      <description>Whilst perusing Mengel Miniatures on my regular trawl of the blogs, I stumbled across an article about “My very first White Dwarf” and it got me all nostalgic and thoughful. What was my first White Dwarf?
White Dwarf 125 it was. It’s long since lost, unfortunately, to a house move that went bad.
andy chambers white dwarf 125 And Games Workshop has only now released the End of Times! Omens and portents abound.</description>

      <description>ratboy is widely (in)famous for his almost tectonic painting speed. That’s not to say that he play with unpainted miniatures; just that he tries to avoid it as often as possible.
He was, at one time, whispered about in fearful tones anywhere players of toy soldiers gather. In Melbourne. he is the man, the myth, the legend: Ratboy!
You have to just know that there’s a story behind that nikcname, right?</description>

      <description>ratboy is widely (in)famous for his almost tectonic painting speed. That’s not to say that he play with unpainted miniatures; just that he tries to avoid it as often as possible.
He was, at one time, whispered about in fearful tones anywhere players of toy soldiers gather. In Melbourne. he is the man, the myth, the legend: Ratboy!
You have to just know that there’s a story behind that nikcname, right?</description>

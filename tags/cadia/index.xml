      <description>Cadia guarded the only known navigable route to and from the massive Warp rift known as the Eye of Terror, a passage called the Cadian Gate. The world&amp;rsquo;s dangerous proximity to the Eye of Terror made it necessary for the people of Cadia to heavily fortify the planet. Cadia still STANDS!
This t-shirt is everything you&amp;rsquo;ve dreamed of and more. It feels soft and lightweight, with the right amount of stretch.</description>

   "body": "Whilst perusing Mengel Miniatures on my regular trawl of the blogs, I stumbled across an article about “My very first White Dwarf” and it got me all nostalgic and thoughful. What was my first White Dwarf?\nWhite Dwarf 125 it was. It’s long since lost, unfortunately, to a house move that went bad.\nandy chambers white dwarf 125 And Games Workshop has only now released the End of Times! Omens and portents abound.\nBack in the halcyon days of 1990, an avid gamer was limited to whatever stock could be found in the FLGS (in this case, Mind Games in Frankston or Melbourne). Either that or ordered through the catalogue pages in the back of the White Dwarf or ordered direct from the UK; expensive at the best of times.\nI particularly remember this issue as it contains an Advanced Hero Quest scenario, The Dark Beneath the World, based on a Gotrek and Felix story that introduced me to the deranged Slayer and his human sidekick. I was unimpressed to have to play the Slayer protagonist in the scenario. That was until our GM threw swathes of nasties from the dungeon’s depths in our path. Gotrek the Slayer waded through seas of spilled enemy blood to help claim the prize; a lost Templar blade guarded by a Chaos Troll. white dwarf 125 staff Check out these fossils!\nOther interesting things in White Dwarf 125?\nAds for non Games Workshop products; including some pretty cool Dark Elf Marauder Miniatures, as well as the more typical Games Workshop products The first pictures of Jes Goodwin’s amazing Eldar Aspect Warriors which still hold up against current miniatures A Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay scenario based on the Plague Daemon short story Preview information from the upcoming Lost and the Damned volume (another classic piece of Warhammer fluff) Epic Imperial Guard rules The usual array of fantastic and crazy ‘Eavy Metal pictures, conversions and articles  You might also like: 50 Shades of Sprue Grey Powered by Inline Related Posts\nold white dwarf 125\nWhite Dwarf 125 is a throw back to a bygone era, however, it reminds me of a different time. It also helps to remind me of the hobby that I love so much and the ways that it has evolved!\nAlso, two months later came White Dwarf 127 that was my first order to UK Mail Order where I acquired a heap of the new and amazing Eldar Aspect Warriors. From there, I was hooked and it was a slippery slide\nWhat was your first?\n"

   "body": "ratboy is widely (in)famous for his almost tectonic painting speed. That’s not to say that he play with unpainted miniatures; just that he tries to avoid it as often as possible.\nHe was, at one time, whispered about in fearful tones anywhere players of toy soldiers gather. In Melbourne. he is the man, the myth, the legend: Ratboy!\nYou have to just know that there’s a story behind that nikcname, right?\nLong ago, as a misty eyed youth, he did what we all consider at some point in our gaming lives; working for Games Workshop. First in retail at the recently opened Chatswood store and then the brand new Sydney store and eventually gravitated to working in Mail Order in the Australian operation where he ran the show for a while. The staff were a bunch of slack jawed yokels. Actually, it was a one man show.\nAs you would imagine, working in the hobby mecca (young and misty eyed, remember?), money flowed freely from the hole in his pocket. Before he knew it, he was in possession of about five kilograms of lead Skaven miniatures.\nAt around the same time, a new guy had started in the warehouse (ratboy still remembers his name, Adam Duggan). Upon one of the first times meeting our hero, for reasons known only to him, he cried, “You look like a rat, boy!”\nAnd the rest is, as they say, history.\nHowever, our story goes back earlier than that to high school. There was a Dungeons and Dragons club that he was drawn into. The games were full of lewd innuendo and casual observation of the rules, but he was hooked.\nThen a few years later was his ah-ha! moment. White Dwarf 125 was his first real exposure to the world of miniature gaming. Oh, sure, he’d had a train set as a kid and made botched attempts at making “realistic” looking scenery using papier-mache and green poster paint, but this, this was the real deal. A world of elves, and goblins, Space Marines and Eldar!\nTo using the wrestling term, he marked out big time for Games Workshop!\nSince then, he have played a LOT of games: Warhammer 40000 (including Rogue Trader), Warhammer Fantasy Battle (when it came with High Elves and Goblins), Mordheim, BloodBowl (the perennial favourite!) and Necromunda.\nToday, there is a near infinite supply of tabletop wargames to suit any and all tastes. he has dabbled in Warmahordes, Malifaux and Bushido. He is (still) seriously loving Infinity and some of the smaller games, like A Fistful of Kung Fu and X-wing.\nratboy is very fortunate to have a games club nearby that plays a lot of these games and many more. However, being all grown up with a wife and kids means that Saturdays spent gaming at Hampton Games Club are getting few and far between.\n"

<h2>About the Geek Trading Co. </h2>
<p>ratboy is widely (in)famous for his almost tectonic painting speed. That’s not to say that he play with unpainted miniatures; just that he tries to avoid it as often as possible.</p>
<p>He was, at one time, whispered about in fearful tones anywhere players of toy soldiers gather. In Melbourne. he is the man, the myth, the legend: Ratboy!</p>
<p>You have to just know that there’s a story behind that nikcname, right?</p>
<p>Long ago, as a misty eyed youth, he did what we all consider at some point in our gaming lives; working for Games Workshop. First in retail at the recently opened Chatswood store and then the brand new Sydney store and eventually gravitated to working in Mail Order in the Australian operation where he ran the show for a while. The staff were a bunch of slack jawed yokels. Actually, it was a one man show.</p>
<p>As you would imagine, working in the hobby mecca (young and misty eyed, remember?), money flowed freely from the hole in his pocket. Before he knew it, he was in possession of about five kilograms of lead Skaven miniatures.</p>
<p>At around the same time, a new guy had started in the warehouse (ratboy still remembers his name, Adam Duggan). Upon one of the first times meeting our hero, for reasons known only to him, he cried, “You look like a rat, boy!”</p>
<p><img src="/images/ratboy-geektrading-co.png" alt="Playing at the defunct Powerfist tournament (circa 2003). Painted army; bad haircut; cool Skaven road show t-shirt."></p>
<p>And the rest is, as they say, history.</p>
<p>However, our story goes back earlier than that to high school. There was a Dungeons and Dragons club that he was drawn into. The games were full of lewd innuendo and casual observation of the rules, but he was hooked.</p>
<p>Then a few years later was his ah-ha! moment. White Dwarf 125 was his first real exposure to the world of miniature gaming. Oh, sure, he’d had a train set as a kid and made botched attempts at making “realistic” looking scenery using papier-mache and green poster paint, but this, this was the real deal. A world of elves, and goblins, Space Marines and Eldar!</p>
<p>To using the wrestling term, he marked out big time for Games Workshop!</p>
<p>Since then, he have played a LOT of games: Warhammer 40000 (including Rogue Trader), Warhammer Fantasy Battle (when it came with High Elves and Goblins), Mordheim, BloodBowl (the perennial favourite!) and Necromunda.</p>
<p>Today, there is a near infinite supply of tabletop wargames to suit any and all tastes. he has dabbled in Warmahordes, Malifaux and Bushido. He is (still) seriously loving Infinity and some of the smaller games, like A Fistful of Kung Fu and X-wing.</p>
<p>ratboy is very fortunate to have a games club nearby that plays a lot of these games and many more. However, being all grown up with a wife and kids means that Saturdays spent gaming at Hampton Games Club are getting few and far between.</p>
